How?
IDK.

Sources for things like Article Content or Images in a database.
I could imagine other views have a section for sources or something...
In said sources they are displayed as image cards if they have something like a cover image.
But what if I linked a markdown source? Easy, that can be something like the raw file, similar to how github does it.
